<h2>Basic Techniques</h2>

    </li>
    <li><b>Tools:</b>Mixing glass, bar spoon</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shaking</h3>
<p>Shaking is used for cocktails that include juices, syrups, or other non-alcoholic mixers, such as the Margarita or Daiquiri. It ensures a thorough mix and proper dilution.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Method:</b>Add ingredients to a shaker with ice. Shake vigorously for about 15 seconds.
    </li>
    <li><b>Tools:</b>Boston shaker or Cobbler shaker.</li>

    </li>

    </li>
    <li><b>Tools:</b>Bar spoon.</li>

    </li>
    <li><b>Tools:</b>Long lighter, fire-safe glassware.</li>
